   Welcome to my space on the webs. This is where I post my full artworks for your visual, mental stimulation and my expression through various techniques I have accumulated over the past couple decades.
   I enjoy learning and becoming better as an artist and a person each day. Peace & Love always.

   I am an art and design student currently completing an Art & Design course at the College of Cape Town. My current skill set is in drawing, painting and printmaking. Additionally, I have training in Adobe digital software programs including Illustrator, InDesign and Photoshop.
