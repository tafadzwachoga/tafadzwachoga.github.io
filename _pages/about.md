   LOL, power is addictiv.

   Welcome to my space on the webs. This is where I post my full artworks for your visual, mental stimulation and my expression through various techniques I have accumulated over the past couple decades.
   I enjoy learning and becoming better as an artist and person each day. Peace & Love always.

   I'm an art and design student currently completing my course at the College of Cape Town. My field of specialty is drawing, painting and printmaking. I'm a graphic designer and have training in Adobe digital software programs including Illustrator, Photoshop and Indesign to create artworks.
